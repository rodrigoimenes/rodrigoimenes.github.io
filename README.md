## About me

```markdown
"Everything you've ever wanted is on the other side of fear" - George Addair
```

As a professional I like to solve challenges, I think they are the main fuel to be always growing in the career. Complex logic solutions are motivating to never give up. I like to talk a lot about the best way to execute routines to always be learning how to be a better programmer.
During my professional years (7+), I found out that much more than just getting better at programming, I need to improve as a person.
In my free time, I am a person who likes to spend time with my wife and my daughter, read about technology and playing online games.

Actually im living in Teres√≥polis-RJ (Brazil)!
