```

As a professional I like to solve challenges. I think the main fuel to be constantly improving my career. Complex logical solutions are my motivation to never give up. I like to discuss about the best way to execute routines so i can always be developing myself aiming to become a better programmer.
During my professional years (7+), I've found out that it's imperative to improve as a person in order to become a better programmer.
In my free time, I am a person who likes to spend time with my wife and my daughter, read about technology and play online games.

I'm actually living in Teres√≥polis-RJ (Brazil)!
